# Wallet - your finances
My next project, which I created due to practice my JavaScript skills. Here you can find features as adding new transaction, removing, updated total balance, current and interactive exchange rate thanks to API and JSON. As a tool I used one of task runners - Gulp.

## General Information
- next project that I created to practice my JavaScript skills. 
- project is still in progress. I realize that the code needs to be improved, but I also want to add other features like a search engine (which will allow the user to search for individual transactions by matching expression) and customize the switching of light and dark modes. 
- The project is very simple, because at this point I wanted to give all my attention to JavaScript, but I plan to improve this part as well.

The user in the project has the ability to work with finances, such as adding a new transaction to the wallet, which can be an income or an expense, and is divided into corresponding groups. Each transaction has a different icon assigned to it. The user can see the total balance, which updates every time a transaction is added or deleted. I then used the API and JSON to create the ability to see the current (updated daily) exchange rate in different currencies. The user can switch currencies and see the current rate.
